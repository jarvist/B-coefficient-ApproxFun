# B-coefficient-ApproxFun

This code uses the enjoyable https://github.com/ApproxFun/ApproxFun.jl package for Functional Approximation in Julia, to read in tabulated data, fit a polynomial and then do some maths + produce some figures.

I've heard that if you say "Chebyshev" five times into a mirror, he'll turn up and fit you a polynomial of best approximation.
